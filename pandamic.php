  <h1 style="font-size:50px"> Embedding community mental health transformation in your COVID-19 recovery</h1>
  <p> About this Event<br><br></br>
As you may know, transformation funding to support stakeholders to realise the radical vision set out in the NHS Long Term Plan and Community Mental Health Framework, is imminent. New investment enters the system from 1 April.<br><br>

At this point, your STP/ICS area should be engaging with your local voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector, and experts by experience, to plan your community mental health transformation. However, we know has not been an easy time to begin this change. People with severe mental illness and the services that support them have been put under unprecedented strain by the Covid-19 pandemic. As we emerge from the crisis, the Community Mental Health Framework offers a path forward to address the challenges that have emerged, as well as those that existed before.<br><br>

The latest in our series of webinars will provide the opportunity to hear from experts by experience and national and local leaders, including Claire Murdoch, National Mental Health Director at NHS England, about how your area can embrace the opportunities offered by the NHS Long Term Plan as local communities begin to rebuild from the pandemic.

We will also introduce you to Rethink Mental Illness' new guide, Keep thinking differently, which provides assistance to overcome any issues or barriers encountered so far and develop a path forward, step-by-step.
