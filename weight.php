<p><CENTER><h2>Tips for Unhealthy Weight Loss
</h2></td>
 Countless weight-loss strategies, diets, potions, and devices have been marketed to the overweight and obese populations. However, despite a plethora of interventions, only an estimated 1% to 3% of dieters end up losing weight and keeping it off.

Snacking before bed won’t automatically make you gain extra weight. It’s what you eat that counts.

Let’s take a look at 15 false and unsuccessful approaches to losing weight.

1. Extreme exercise

Successful weight loss involves making small changes that last a lifetime, and extreme amounts of exercise to shed unwanted pounds are untenable. Although people who are overweight or obese probably need to exceed the 150 minutes of exercise per week that is generally recommended for all adults, there’s no reason to go overboard. Simply creating a caloric deficit through a healthy diet in combination with physical activity will give you the best long-term results.<br><br>

2. Cutting out carbs

When eaten in moderation as part of a healthy diet—without butter, cream cheese, and so forth—carbs likely won’t result in weight gain. Furthermore, whole-grain carbs such as brown rice and whole grain bread increase fiber intake while dieting. Just don’t fry starches to lose weight, which can result in weight gain through excess fat and calories, as well as buildup of advanced glycation end products.<br><br>

3. Drink more water, lose more weight

Water itself doesn’t cause weight loss. However, it does maintain hydration status and can make you feel full, decreasing the desire for snacks. Moreover, sometimes thirst can mask hunger, and when a person is thirsty they may indulge in more snacking.<br><br>

4. Working out on an empty stomach burns fat

When you work out, your body needs energy. One rumor that has gained traction is that the body burns off fat in these circumstances. Wrong! The body first goes after sugar stored in muscles, which results in muscle breakdown.<br><br>

5. Certain foods speed up your metabolism

Although unsupported by evidence, some claim that foods high in sugar and caffeine speed up metabolism, thus resulting in weight loss. Others claim that eating spicy foods, like chili peppers and hot sauce, will boost your metabolism so you burn more calories. Don’t be fooled! The only thing you’ll burn is your mouth.<br><br>
